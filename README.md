# Windows Free Activator V5.1

## About Windows Free Activator
Windows Free Activator is a powerful, open-source and easy-to-use
script designed to activate Windows 10 and 11 for free by connecting
to a KMS (Key Management Service) server.

KMS servers emulate Microsoft's activation process, granting temporary
activation for Windows without requiring a product key. The script connects
to a KMS server, sends activation requests using a Generic Volume License
Key (GVLK), and receives a response that grants activation, typically for 180 days.
